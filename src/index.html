					<br /><br />My name's Jamie Dowers. I'm a creative software engineer
					with an interest in creating interactive experiences using the latest
					front-end technologies. Since starting my programming journey I have
					gained experience in React, JavaScript, WebGL, THREEjs, C#, PHP, CSS,
					HTML, and a wide range of related frameworks and libraries.
					<br /><br />
					I have a Bachelor in ICT with a double major in Web/Mobile Development
					and Software Engineering. Upon graduating I was awarded the Best
					Software Developer Award for outstanding achievement. Following this I
					then travelled to Auckland to win the Robert Walters' Nation-wide
					Hackathon.
					<br /><br />
					I'm currently based in the Lower North Island of New Zealand.
					<br /><br />
					I have a huge passion for creative development and would love to chat
					with you regarding my availability for freelance work or to become a
					part of your team.

				In my years as a professional I have worked closely with many local web
				based agencies including Webtech and Pivot Design. Recently I have been
				working as a Front End Developer at Yorb Ltd where I have been using
				React, HTML, CSS, JS, and Microsoft's Power Platform.

				<button class="accordion acc-title">Yorb Ltd</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						I started my career at Yorb on the support Desk before moving into a
						systems engineer role and then ultimately into a front end developer
						position. My daily tasks include creating and maintaining websites,
						Power Apps, Power Automate Flows, and custom software solutions. Our
						team uses an Agile approach utilizing Azure DevOps alongside
						ConnectWise. We are a small team of developers who work with
						Business Analysts, Client Managers, and Technical Consultants to
						meet our clients needs.
						<br /><br />
						Technologies used include: React, MS Power Platform, HTML, CSS, JS,
						Azure, and more.

				<button class="accordion acc-title">Pivot Design</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						I was contracted to assist Pivot Design's web development team.
						During my time working with Pivot I was employed as a completely
						remote developer. Being remote has its own set of challenges but was
						a great learning opportunity for me and a new way to form
						relationships with the other developers and designers. While at
						Pivot I was exposed to numerous client sites that were being updated
						to more modern frameworks.<br /><br />
						Technologies used include: WordPress, HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, FileZilla,
						and more.

				<button class="accordion acc-title">Webtech Creative</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						At Webtech I was one of the inhouse web developers. During this role
						I gained exposure to working with designers and developers across
						the globe. This role helped me to understand the importance of
						having good clear communications and requirements when working with
						customer sites. While working at Webtech I was given the opportunity
						to code their current live website.<br /><br />
						Technologies used include: HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, UIKit, Figma, Joomla,
						Git, and more.

				<button class="accordion acc-title">Additional Experiences</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						Before pursuing a career in development I spent a couple years
						working at a local dairy farm in the Manawatu and previous to this I
						was an aquatic supervisor at many of the local pools. I have also
						completed my comprehensive first aid certificate and numerous
						customer service courses.

				Below is a list of personal projects that I have completed along with
				the tools and technologies used to achieve the results. Many of these
				projects use a JavaScript framework (R3F, THREEjs, or React) and are
				deployed using Vercel and either Vite or Webpack. <br /><br />

				<button class="accordion acc-title">Portfolio</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						Since you are here I thought my Portfolio site would be a good place
						to start.<br />
						This Portfolio is built using THREE.js, HTML, JS, GSAP, and CSS.<br /><br />
						The hero image utilizes the vertex and fragment glsl shaders to
						portray the movement of the colours and to create a reaction to any
						noise picked up via the microphone. The hero also utilizes the orbit
						camera to allow the user to rotate around the centre sphere.
						<br /><br />
						The flag uses a similar shader technique although this uses time
						rather than sound to move the vertex and create a wave like motion.
						The following two 3d models are animated using GSAP based on the
						position of the user on the page. The stars are also randomly
						generated points so will change when the page is refreshed giving
						each user a different experience

				<button class="accordion acc-title">Ball Run Game</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						This game was created using react-three-fibre and using a range of
						different techniques. The game consists of one level that changes on
						each render by randomly selecting 10 play sections from an array.
						The array consists of three individual sections that have obstacles
						with randomly generated motions and start points. The physics are
						created by using rapier's physics engine and all geometries are
						created by manipulating the default THREEjs geometries (aside from
						the hamburger). The hamburger was created in blender. The game uses
						React hooks such as useEffect, useState, and useMemo.<br /><br />

					</p>

				<button class="accordion acc-title">Animated Ocean</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						This project is build using THREEjs and uses the fragment and vertex
						glsl shaders to create patterns that form waves. The waves change
						colour based on their height. I have allowed most variables to be
						adjusted by the user on a user friendly gui. The wave movement is
						based on time and give a nice illusion of a real ocean. The project
						also has orbit controls to allow for a completely immersive view of
						the waves. <br /><br />

					</p>
				</div>

				<button class="accordion acc-title">Animated Galaxy</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						This is another THREEjs project that utilizes the fragment and
						vertex shaders alongside the time function. I have again left a gui
						available to enhance the user experience as you are able to adjust
						variables and make the scene unique to your preference. I have also
						linked a similar galaxy project without the animation to showcase
						the particles and allow for a closer look at how the branches and
						colours merge/interact with each other. <br /><br />

				<button class="accordion acc-title">Portal Scene</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						This portal scene was created in blender and then imported using
						react-three-fibre to be displayed on the web. The portal itself uses
						a custom shader material to give it an animated look. The fireflies
						are generated using the sparkles package from drei. I really enjoyed
						creating this project as it gave me a chance to create my own 3d
						model and then use my knowledge of tools to present and immerse
						myself and viewers into the scene.<br /><br />
